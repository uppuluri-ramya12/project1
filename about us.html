    <p class="header">Taking a newborn care class during pregnancy can prepare caregivers for their future responsibilities. During
         the stay in a hospital or a birthing center, clinicians and nurses help with basic baby care and demonstrate how to perform it. Newborn care basics include:
  Handling a newborn, including supporting the baby's neck
        Bathing
        Dressing
        Swaddling
        Soothing[1]
        Feeding and burping
        Cleaning the umbilical cord
        Using a bulb syringe to clear the baby's nasal passages
        Taking a newborn's temperature
        Immunization
        Change the baby's diaper on time to prevent diaper rash
        Before leaving the hospital, ask about home visits by a nurse or health care worker. Many new parents appreciate somebody checking in with them and their baby a few days after coming home. If breastfeeding, the mother can ask whether a lactation consultant can visit her and the baby at home to provide follow-up support and help with finding other resources in the community, such as peer support groups.[1]
        
        Many first-time parents also welcome the help of an experienced family member or friend. Having a support person stay with the newborn for a few days can give the mother the confidence to go at it alone in the weeks ahead. This can be arranged before delivery.[1]
        
        The baby's first doctor's visit is another good time to ask any infant care questions. Parents can ask about the various reasons to call the doctor and inquire about the vaccines their baby needs. Young children need vaccines because the diseases they protect against can strike at an early age and can be very dangerous in childhood. This includes both rare diseases and more common ones, such as the flu.[1]
        
        Caring for a newborn also includes health screening of the newborn. Most of the time this occurs in the hospital or pediatrician's office shortly after birth. Every state screens babies for more than two dozen disorders. Early detection of a disorder can prevent future complications.[2]
